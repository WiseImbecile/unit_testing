This project contains a unit test file for testing two different methods. 

Your job is to write code test-driven development-style by looking at the tests, 
and then writing the code necessary to make all of the tests pass. 
Thus, for each of the two methods, you must 
 ~ determine the range of inputs you are expected to support, 
 ~ determine the expected behavior for various inputs, and then 
 ~ write the code to produce that behavior. 

Additional rules:
 ~ You may not change any of the given code whatsoever. 
 ~ You are only expected to write two methods, and thus 
   you may only write two methods total to make the tests pass.


Then,
Write two additional tests of your choosing in the unit test. 
Name these tests myTest01 and myTest02. Make sure your code also 
passes these tests. (These tests may be for the same methods you 
are already expected to write, or you may write tests involving 
new code. That choice is up to you.)
